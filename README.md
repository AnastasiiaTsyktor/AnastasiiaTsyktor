## Hi there!

I am a Data Analyst based in Spain with a background in digital marketing and SEO. 

I specialize in transforming raw data into clear insights and business recommendations through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.

My analytical focus includes customer behavior, satisfaction metrics, and performance KPIs. I work with SQL, Tableau, and Python to explore patterns, build dashboards, and support data-driven decision making.
